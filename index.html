                    <p>Hi, my name is Jasbir but most people call me Jas/Jaz and I am a Web Designer/Developer living in West Yorkshire.<br><br>

                    Ever since I was young I have been fascinated by ICT in which I pursued that passion when I studied it for GCSE and was rewarded with a Distinction for my efforts.<br><br>

                    After Secondary School I left to go to Leeds City College where i obtained a M/M/M grade in BTEC Nationals for IT Practitioners: Software Development. I studied at the University of Huddersfield on the course BSc Web Technologies in which I now have a degree in with Honours. <br><br>

                    For the past 9 years I have been working in banking however I am looking for a career change so I have been relearning and refining my craft to try and achieve this goal by enrolling in The Coders Guild Skills Bootcamp in Web Design and Development. <br/><br>

                    In my spare time, I enjoy playing football, gaming, watching movies/sports, listening to music and writing lyrics.</p>
